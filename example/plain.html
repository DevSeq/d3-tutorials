HTML
<br/><br/>
Basics
<br/><br/>
HTML is designed for marking up text by adding tags such as &lt;p&gt; to create HTML elements. HTML tags begin with &lt; and end with &gt;. Tags often occur in pairs of opening and closing tags. Some tags such as &lt;img&gt; always occur alone. Those tags usually (but not required to) have trailing slash.
<br/><br/>
Tags can have attributes. For example, &lt;a&gt; tag has href attribute for defining link target. Similarly, &lt;img&gt; tag has src attribute for defining image source.
